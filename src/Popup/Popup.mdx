# Popup

Popups are low-level components that detect clicks outside their bounds. They're used in [Select](./Select.md) components.

## Properties

<PropsTable of={Popup} />

## Children

The `Popup` component accepts arbitrary children. If a function is passed in the `children` prop, it will receive the `close` callback as its only parameter:

<Playground>
	<Popup>
		{
			close => 
				<button onClick={close}>Close yourself</button>
		}
	</Popup>
</Playground>

## CSS

The `Popup` component has the class name **`uix-popup`**.

`Popup` components are positioned absolutely and will be sized by their content.
