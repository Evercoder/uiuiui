# Popup

Popups are low-level components that detect clicks outside their bounds. They're used in [Select](./Select.md) components.

## Properties

| `property`  | Any      | _none_  | [An optional identifier][property] to pass along to the callback functions.                                                                                                 |
| `autofocus` | Boolean  | `false` | Whether the component should autofocus when it's mounted in the DOM.                                                                                                        |
| `onClose`   | Function | _none_  | A callback function that gets invoked when there's a click outside the bounds of the popup. When the `property` prop is set, it will be passed back as the second argument. |

## Children

The `Popup` component accepts arbitrary children. If a function is passed in the `children` prop, it will receive the `close` callback as its only parameter:

```jsx
<Popup>{close => <button onClick={close}>Close yourself</button>}</Popup>;
```

## CSS

The `Popup` component has the class name **`uix-popup`**.

`Popup` components are absolutely positioned and will have the dimensions of its content.
