# Portal

Portals are low-level components that can place their children in any DOM element. Additionally, they can mirror the size and position of another DOM element. They're used in [Select](./Select.md) components.

## Properties

| Property    | Type        | Default | Description                                                                        |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `className` | String      | _none_  | Additional class names to add to the component.                                    |
| `target`    | DOM Element | _none_  | The DOM element where to place the component's children, via `React.createPortal`. |
| `mirror`    | DOM Element | _none_  | An optional DOM element whose size and position the Portal should mirror.          |

## Children

The `Portal` component accepts arbitrary children.

## CSS

Portals are identified by the class name **`uix-portal`**.

They are absolutely positioned and will derive their size and position based on the DOM element they mirror.

**Note:** Since a Portal will place its children outside the DOM subtree of its parent, make sure to add identifying class names to the Portal's children.
